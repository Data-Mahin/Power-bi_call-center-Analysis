# Power-bi_call-center-Analysis
This project focuses on creating an interactive dashboard to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) related to call center operations. The dashboard provides insights into total calls, call duration, response time, and other relevant metrics. Various graphs and a detailed overview table are included to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the data.
The grid overview table allows for a deeper dive into individual call records and supports further analysis.
